# 'files' is a list of the files this map will refer to (minimum 1). For best
# results, put fieldMaps & their file(s) in the same directory -otherwise list
# relative paths

files:
    - filename.xlsx
    - ../otherDir/file2.csv

# 'fields' are all Sites fields currently in the database (on Airtable).
#  - Put the column name corresponding to the field in the space after the
#    colon.
#  - Each schema map can be used for multiple files, provided the columns from
#    which you want to preserve data are named exactly the same.
#  - If uploading multiple files with unique column names, multiply this file as
#    many times as necessary (the extension must be .yml).
#  - Any fields not marked 'required' may be left blank.
#  - Use 'notesAnythingElse' for generic Notes per row that don't fit in other
#    fields.
#  - Merge multiple columns into 1 field by listing with -'s (like 'files'
#    above).

    siteName: column name here # required
    siteStreetAddress: second sample column name # required
    siteCity: # required
    siteState: # required, put a 2-letter state code (CA, NY...) to hard-code if
               # there's no State column & all are in same state.
    siteZip: # if sites are from various States but there's no value for that
             # field, siteZip is a required substitute
